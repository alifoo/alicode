# Study Less

To study less, first try to listen and understand what the professor is saying. Take notes only of those things that you know you will forget, or that are important keys to understand.

## There are no such things as "Disciplines"

There is only the Universe: Concepts and ideas floating around. Everything is somehow connected.
Creativity is not only making something new, but making unique connections between ideas.

## Wikipedia already exists

If you already know something, there's no need to write it down.

## Notes are fluid, just like your mind
